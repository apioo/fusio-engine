 * Through the connector it is possible to access configured connection objects. A connection is i.e. a MYSQL connection
 * which can be configured at the admin panel. Inside an action it is possible to access this connection through this
 * class. Which objects is returned depends on the connection type i.e. the MYSQL connection returns a Doctrine DBAL
 * Connection instance and the HTTP connection returns a Guzzle instance. There are already many adapters available
 * which allow many different kind of services i.e. ElasticSearch, MongoDB, AMQP, etc.
